# Python-PDF-Editor
A Python console-based tool to merge PDF (.pdf) files using PyPDF2

Python PDF Editor is a simple script to display a menu in the console or command-line. Using this menu, you can merge all PDF (.pdf) files in a directory/folder into one, or you can manually select the files you would like to merge. Additionally, you can resize, encrypt, decrypt, and re-encrypt PDF files. While this program should function on all operating systems, I have only been able to test it on Windows.

To launch the console-based menu, run the app.py file from the command line, your IDE, or numerous other methods.
